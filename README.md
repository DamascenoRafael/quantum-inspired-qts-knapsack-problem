# Quantum-Inspired Algorithm<br/>Quantum Tabu Search - 0/1 Knapsack Problem

This repository refers to the final work of the discipline: **Introduction to Quantum Computing**, PESC / COPPE / UFRJ [CPS748](https://profmarquezino.wordpress.com/category/introducao-a-computacao-quantica/), taught by Professor [Franklin Marquezino](https://www.cos.ufrj.br/~franklin/) during the second quarter of 2019.

Implementation based on article:  
[Quantum-Inspired Tabu Search Algorithm for Solving 0/1 Knapsack Problems](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2001891)


## About

The purpose of this repository is to evaluate the performance of a quantum-inspired algorithm applied to the Knapsack Problem 0/1, meaning each element may or may not be in the solution, without repetition. The ideas in the implementation present in this repository can serve as a basis for different algorithms and problems that can gain with this approach.


## Running algorithm

The code were written in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and are available in the `qts-knapsack-problem.ipynb` file. 

In the `data` directory you can find some problems that can be executed by the algorithm.
